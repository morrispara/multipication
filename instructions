// 1. Print 2 Random Integers, X & Y, each between 3 and 9, as a soluble equation:  X * Y = ??
// 2. Receive manual input for solution, say "Correct!" if match, "Incorrect!" if not.
// 3. Embed equation in While loop that continues until entry matches solution, or = "stop".
// 4. Embed all code in a For loop and run it 10 times.

// 1. Move code parts 1-3 into a function called multiPractice, and call the function within the For loop.
// 2. Count how many wrong answers and return count.
// 3. Calculate wrong answer percent of all answers (hint: all answers = equations + wrong answers)
// 4. At "stop" or at loop end, report wrong answer percent.  If no wrong answers, say "Charlie, you've won!"
